# track-times

This is a project for working on comparing times of different track races. I'm trying to compare the rates of different races run, and how distance affects the rate. To do this, I'm trying to find a representative time for each distance. I'm doing this by looking at the personal bests of the top times for each distance found at http://www.alltime-athletics.com/men.htm. I'm still not sure whether to use the mean of the top times or what, but I'll figure that out.
